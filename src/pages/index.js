          <h2>About the Tool</h2>
          <p>
            This tool provides a way to explore racial disparities in support of
            the California Racial Justice Act (CRJA) (California Penal Code
            (CPC) section 745). Enacted in 2020 and amended in 2022, the CRJA
            provides a mechanism for defendants (and the convicted) in a
            particular county to challenge a charge, conviction, or sentence if
            it is sought or obtained in a racially disparate manner. Throughout
            the CRJA, racial disparities also encompass ethnicity and national
            origin.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The CRJA specifically addresses four types of conduct. The first two
            forms focus on the particulars of the case at hand: first, the
            exhibition of bias or animus towards the defendant by the state, a
            witness, or juror, and, second, the use of discriminatory language
            about or exhibition of bias or animus towards the defendant in court
            (unless quoting another person). The third and fourth forms of
            conduct, which concern charging and sentencing, require “evidence
            that the prosecution more frequently sought or obtained” harsher
            charging, conviction, or sentencing outcomes against people who are
            of the same race as the defendant. This tool focuses on the latter
            two forms of conduct.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make a “pattern of disparity” claim under the CRJA requires two
            showings. First, in relevant part, CPC section 745(a)(3) states
            that, in the charging or conviction context, the defendant must be
            “charged or convicted of a more serious offense than defendants of
            other races, ethnicities, or national origins who have engaged in
            similar conduct and are similarly situated.” Second, CPC section
            745(a)(3) further provides that “the evidence [must] establish[]
            that the prosecution more frequently sought or obtained convictions
            for more serious offenses against people who share the defendant’s
            race, ethnicity, or national origin in the county where the
            convictions were sought or obtained.” Similarly, in the context of
            sentencing, CPC section 745(a)(4) states that a defendant must first
            show that “a longer or more severe sentence was imposed on the
            defendant than was imposed on other similarly situated individuals
            convicted of the same offense,” then show either that “longer or
            more severe sentences were more frequently imposed for that offense
            on people that share the defendant’s race, ethnicity, or national
            origin than on defendants of other races, ethnicities, or national
            origins in the county where the sentence was imposed” or that
            “longer or more severe sentences were more frequently imposed for
            the same offense on defendants in cases with victims of one race,
            ethnicity, or national origin than in cases with victims of other
            races, ethnicities, or national origins, in the county where the
            sentence was imposed.”{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            CPC section 745(c)(1) provides that “[i]f a motion is filed in the
            trial court and the defendant makes a prima facie showing of a
            violation of subdivision (a), the trial court shall hold a hearing.”
            Furthermore, “evidence may be presented by either party [at the
            hearing], including, but not limited to, statistical evidence,
            aggregate data, expert testimony, and the sworn testimony of
            witnesses.” CPC section 745(d) states that data may be sought for
            good cause. According to CPC section 745(h)(1), “more frequently
            sought or obtained” or “more frequently imposed” means that "the
            totality of the evidence demonstrates a significant difference in
            seeking or obtaining convictions or in imposing sentences comparing
            individuals who have engaged in similar conduct and are similarly
            situated, and the prosecution cannot establish race-neutral reasons
            for the disparity. . . Statistical significance is a factor the
            court may consider, but is not necessary to establish a significant
            difference. ”

          <h2>About the Data</h2>
          <p>
            The source for data on this site is a comprehensive dataset of all
            arrests, charges, convictions, and sentences in California (Criminal
            Offender Record Information (CORI)), available to researchers
            through the California Department of Justice Automated Criminal
            History System (ACHS) through the CA DOJ Research Data Request
            process. Our records were downloaded between 9/23/2021 and
            9/29/2021; the data we present therefore ranges from 2010 through
            (nearly) the first nine months of 2021.* Among known disadvantages
            of the CORI data are that it does not include information on legal
            representation, plea-bargaining, or the conditions of the arrest
            (such as whether or not a weapon was present) which might
            legitimately be taken into account by the prosecution in deciding to
            characterize an alleged crime as a particular offense, or as a
            felony or misdemeanor. Two additional shortcomings of our database
            are that it does not include juvenile records or out-of-state
            records. Errors in underlying data are due to reporting errors
            and/or fundamental limitations to the Automated Criminal History
            System set up and maintained by CA DOJ.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CORI source data used for the tool are anonymous, with names
            removed and separate individuals identified only by an internal ID
            code. Personally identifying information, such as date of birth or
            social security number, has been removed. The tool reports summaries
            of the CORI data that have been processed to calculate counts (raw
            numbers) or rates for the specified user query. These summaries are
            never reported at the level of a particular individual.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>*</b>2021 rates per population are adjusted upward by 12/9 to
            account for the limitation of the data to the first 9 months of the
            year.
          </p>
        </GenericPage>
        <GenericPage id="methodology">
          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            On the "Paper Prisons Racial Justice Act Tool" page, you can
            customize the data in various ways. This methodology section
            presents important information about the data provided in this
            website and how you can use it for your own analysis.
          </p>
          <h3>Customization</h3>
          <p>
            You can customize the data presented by year, county, event point,
            race/ethnicity, measurement (metric), and offense. Data you see will
            depend upon your customization for each category. The{" "}
            <strong>event points</strong> include arrests, charges filed in
            court, convictions, felony convictions, and prison sentences. We
            explain the different <strong>measurements</strong> available and
            how they are calculated, as well as some limitations of the data,
            below.
          </p>
          <h3>Incidents & Lifecycle of a Case </h3>
          <p>
          The source (CORI) data set records each of the events associated with a given cycle of an individual’s involvement with the criminal justice system, where a cycle is defined as the series of events in the criminal justice system that flow from a specific initial incident for an individual. A cycle typically begins with an arrest, in which a person may be charged with one or more offenses. The arrest step may be followed by a prosecutor filing charges in court on one or more offenses. Offenses in court may be the same as or different from those charged at arrest. The offenses charged at court lead to a disposition on each offense, such as a conviction, dismissal, acquittal, or other outcome. A conviction results in a sentence, which may include incarceration. The CORI data come from the courts, not from the corrections system, so we do not have information on actual incarcerations or terms served, only sentences to incarceration.
          </p>
          <p>
          In our tool, we count the number of incidents for which a given offense was charged. An incident is associated with a specific offense charged in a specific cycle. Multiple counts of the same offense charged for the same incident are only counted once in the tool. For example, suppose that following a particular arrest, a person ended up convicted in court on three counts of PC 242 (battery) and two counts of PC 148(A)(1) (obstructing/ resisting). For this cycle, we would count one incident of conviction for PC 242 and one incident of conviction for PC 148(A)(1). We applied the same approach at the arrest and charge in court levels.
          </p>
          <p>
          For arrest events, the year of the incident recorded in the tool is the minimum (first) year for the cycle. For court events (all non-arrest events), the year is the maximum (last) year for the cycle. We count any event that occurs in a cycle up to the last event. We assign years this way to take account of the fact that someone might be arrested on a charge in one year and go to court in a subsequent year.
          </p>
          <h3>Event Points</h3>
          <p>
            Racial disparities can occur at each of a number of specific event
            points in the criminal justice system. The tool provides metrics at
            the following specific event points.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arrest</li>
            <li>Charge filed at court</li>
            <li>Conviction (including misdemeanors and felonies)</li>
            <li>Felony conviction</li>
            <li>Prison sentence</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Offenses</h3>
          <p>
          The CORI data set used for the tool includes information on a large number of criminal (California Penal Code) offenses; however, there are very small sample sizes for many offenses and populations, especially at the county-specific level. Due to confidentiality concerns, our website does not display data for any selections for which the metric of interest is constructed from samples of the data that contain 10 or fewer observations. Our charts and tables will show gaps and/or "N/A" when data are not available. This restriction results in very limited coverage of offenses in the smallest counties– in fact, we cannot report data for any offenses in California’s least populous county, Alpine County. Even in larger counties, the tool may not be able to display results for offenses that are relatively uncommon.
          </p>
          <p>
          Each Penal Code subsection is treated as a distinct offense (for example, PC 148(A) is treated as a distinct offense from PC 148(B)). Despite this level of detail, users should be aware that identifying offenses with PC subsections lumps together some charges that come under a single subsection but have different consequences. Examples would include so-called “wobbler” offenses that are felonies by default but may be charged as misdemeanors under some conditions. Burglary, which is PC 459, may be charged as first-degree or second-degree burglary, but the source data do not always distinguish the degree, so these charges are combined into a single offense code. Some common offenses are for probation violations (e.g., Penal Code section 1203.2), and their only corresponding event point is an arrest. For any given incident, the offense charged at court may be different from the offense cited at arrest, given prosecutorial decisions and plea bargaining. To ease searching, we include not just the PC code section number but the offense description (such as “PC 148(A) PC-OBSTRUCTS/RESISTS PUBLIC OFFICER/ETC”) most commonly attached to that offense code in the CORI data.
          </p>
          <h3>Measurements</h3>
          <p>Three different metrics can be viewed in the tool:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Raw number</b> is a count of the actual number of incidents
                in the selected category defined by county, offense, year, race,
                and event point. For example, a query of the tool for
                convictions in Alameda County in 2016 for Black persons on the
                offense PC 148(A)(1) returns a raw number of 58. This means
                there were 58 incidents involving convictions of Black persons
                on the charge of PC 148(A)(1) recorded in Alameda County in
                2016. The tool counts incidents, not individuals, so 58
                conviction incidents might represent fewer than 58 individuals,
                because a given individual might have been charged with the same
                offense on more than one occasion.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Rate per population</b> measures the rate at which a given
                event or decision occurs for a selected racial or ethnic group,
                relative to that group’s total population in the county.
                Specifically, it is the raw number of criminal justice decisions
                of the requested type for the requested ethnic group during the
                requested year, per 100 individuals of that group in the county
                population. Population data come from the American Community
                Survey (ACS), which is a large national survey run by the U.S.
                Census Bureau. All of our population estimates for different
                ethnicities use the 5-year ACS sample for the combined period
                2016-2020. ACS summary tables were accessed through the Census
                Bureau API interface (see{" "}

              </p>
              <p>
                Example: If there were 350 incidents in which Hispanic
                individuals had been arrested in county X on a charge of PC 459
                (burglary) during the year in question, and the Hispanic
                population of county X was 100,000, the rate per 100 population
                would be 350/(100,000/100) = 0.35 per 100 population.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Population disparity v. White</b> compares the rate per
                population of a given racial/ethnic group with that of
                non-Hispanic White individuals. The racial gap can be considered
                the chance that a person of the given race/ethnicity experiences
                a certain outcome or decision, relative to the chances of a
                non-Hispanic White adult, given underlying populations.
              </p>
              <p>A "population disparity v. white" value greater than 1.0 indicates that a specific racial/ethnic group experiences a higher rate of a particular outcome or decision compared to non-Hispanic whites, considering their respective population sizes. Conversely, a value less than 1.0 suggests that the specified group is less likely to experience the outcome relative to non-Hispanic whites, given the underlying populations. A value of 1.00 means that the two groups experience the outcome at the same rate relative to population.</p>
              <p>
                Example: Suppose that in a particular county in a particular
                year, there were 2 incidents in which Black adults experienced
                felony convictions for burglary for every 100 Black individuals
                in the population, and 1 such incident per 100 non-Hispanic
                White individuals. Then the population disparity for the
                Black relative to White population is 2/1 = 2.{" "}
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Racial classifications</h3>
          <p>
            The DOJ CORI data source indicates the racial/ethnic identity of
            each individual with a single mutually exclusive “race” identifier.
            The classifications include Black, Hispanic, Native American, White,
            a number of Asian/Pacific Islander identities, as well as “other”
            and unknown categories. Multiple racial identities are not recorded.
            The tool collapses the various CORI categories into five groups:
            Asian American/Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, Native American,
            and White. Other groups are not included in the tool. How
            racial/ethnic groups are assigned in the CORI data (whether
            self-identified or assigned by authorities) is not indicated in the
            source.
          </p>
          <p>
            The racial/ethnic classifications used by the Census Bureau (ACS),
            from which we obtain population numbers, do not correspond directly
            to the CORI data categories. In particular, the ACS asks separate
            questions about racial identity and Hispanic/Latino identity, and
            allows individuals to belong to more than one race. For our
            comparisons, we use the following correspondences. The ACS
            categories we use are not mutually exclusive, but in our judgment
            are likely to correspond reasonably well to the CORI mutually
            exclusive categories.

          <h3>Combining Data </h3>

          The tool permits data to be combined across years, counties, or offenses. When a user selects multiple values, the values displayed reflect aggregate counts in the case of raw count metrics (e.g. adding counts from 2018 and counts from 2019). In the case of rate per population or disparity gap per population metrics, the values displayed reflect weighted averages, taking into account combined event and combined population counts. When an underlying data point is unavailable, due data limitations, the tool will simply not include that data point in the calculation and will also include a message warning the user that not all selected values are reflected in the displayed values. As such, we encourage users to select the “View Data” to see which values are actually included in the aggregation, and to consider the metrics individually whenever also considering them in combination.

          <p>Example where rate data is aggregated: Suppose there were 350 incidents in which Hispanic individuals had been arrested in county X on a charge of PC 459 (burglary) during the year in question, and the Hispanic population of county X was 100,000, The rate per 100 population in county X would be 350/(100,000/100) = 0.35 per 100 population. Suppose that for another country, county Y, there were also 350 incidents in which Hispanic individuals had been arrested on a charge of PC 459 (burglary) during the year in question, but the Hispanic population of county Y was 350,000. The rate per 100 population in county X would be 350/(350,000/100) = 0.10 per 100 population. To get the aggregate rate across counties X and Y, the numerators and denominators would be added, for a combined number of arrests of Hispanic individuals of 700 and a combined Hispanic population of 350,000 + 100,000 = 450,000. The combined rate per 100 population in county X and Y would be 700/(450,000/100) = 0.157 per 100 population.</p>
          <p>Example where data is limited: Suppose that in a particular county in a particular year, say 2019, there were 12 incidents in which Native American adults experienced felony convictions for burglary, and in 2018, the number of equivalent incidents was N/A, due to the total being 10 or fewer. The raw count metrics for 2018 and 2019 in combination would still reflect 12 incidents, and a warning message would appear. In the case where the metric is the population disparity v. white gap, the chance that a person of the given race/ethnicity experiences a certain outcome or decision, relative to the chances of a non-Hispanic white adult, given underlying populations, and the data for either white or non-white populations is insufficient, neither will be included.</p>

          <h2>About the Initiative</h2>
          <p>
            The Paper Prisons Initiative (paperprisons.org) is a
            multi-disciplinary research initiative focused on documenting and
            narrowing the “second chance gap” between eligibility for relief
            from the criminal justice system and its delivery due to hurdles in
            access to relevant information and data. The paper that describes
            the concept of the “second chance gap” is Colleen V. Chien,
